# MQ 135 Wifi Air quality sensor


This is a project involving the esp8266 and mq135 sensor to create a module which will be able to measure the air quality in a specific location and can be connected wirelessly to the internet.

Modules needed for this project and where they can be bau
[ESP8266 Microprocessor](https://amzn.to/2LbvQIa)
[OLED Display](ttps://amzn.to/2L8X81F)
[MQ135 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/39Ch4ny)
[Breadboard](https://amzn.to/2YM6YyS)
[Connecting wires](https://amzn.to/2L8Xc1p)



Wiring will look like this
