# MQ 135 Wifi Air quality sensor


This is a project involving the esp8266 and mq135 sensor to create a module which will be able to measure the air quality in a specific location and can be connected wirelessly to the internet.

Modules needed for this project and where they can be bought:

- [ESP8266 Microprocessor](https://amzn.to/2LbvQIa)
- [OLED Display](https://amzn.to/2L8X81F)
- [MQ135 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/39Ch4ny)
- [Breadboard](https://amzn.to/2YM6YyS)
- [Connecting wires](https://amzn.to/2L8Xc1p)


## Air Quality Index
The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean or polluted your air is and how it may affect your health.
